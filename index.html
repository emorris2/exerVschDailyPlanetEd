    You're the new editor of the Daily Planet, and you're committed to bringing the newspaper up to a modern-day standard. In order to do this, you're moving the paper online and are teaching all the Planet's writers to code.

As the editor, each piece of code needs to pass your desk for your approval before being shown to the public. Your job is to check for the following issues in every program that comes across your desk:

Is the writer using variables correctly?
Is the writer using operators correctly?
Is the writer spelling things correctly? (Misspelled programs don't just look bad, they can break!)
Is the writer following best practices with JavaScript code conventions?
Clone the code down from this repository and fix the code until it correctly follows JavaScript code standards and works the way it should.

Make sure you remove the V School remote url from the local repository, too.
